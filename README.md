**mod_swift** allows you to write native modules
for the
[Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org)
in the 
[Swift](http://swift.org/)
programming language.
**Server Side Swift the [right](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com/) way**.

This project/sourcedir contains the actual C-language `mod_swift`.
It is a straight Apache module which is then used to load Swift based Apache 
modules (mods_xyz).

Also included are Xcode base configurations, module maps for Apache and APR
as well as a few API wrappers that are used to workaround `swiftc` crashers
and Swift-C binding limitations.

**Note**: mod_swift is very low level, we currently provide two efforts to
          make Apache module development more pleasant:
          the Swift [Apache API](https://github.com/modswift/Apache),
          and [ApacheExpress](https://apacheexpress.io/).
          The latter provides a very convenient Node.js/ExpressJS like API
          which makes it very easy to write modules.

### Documentation

You can find pretty neat mod_swift documentation over here:
[docs.mod-swift.org](http://docs.mod-swift.org/).

### Status

- 2022-05-08:
  - Updated for macOS 12 M1 Homebrew. Back in a working state!
  - Note that [Homebrew APRUtil](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/31799/commits/584a9faa5c2decf32f25bb9d5f028395bb93ab5f) 
    only comes w/ the SQLite driver. To use other drivers with
    [mod_dbd](http://docs.mod-swift.org/mod_dbd/), a manual install
    is necessary.
- 2017-06-12:
  - This is not a demo anymore, it actually seems to work quite well.
